# OABS_Project

## Overview
Welcome to the **Online Apartment Booking System (OABS)** repository! This project is developed as part of my **Software Management Process** course, guided by my professor. The aim is to create an efficient and user-friendly platform for online apartment booking, implementing key principles of software design and management.

## Features
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Designed with Nielsenâ€™s Usability Heuristics to ensure ease of use and accessibility.
- **Streamlined Booking Process:** Allows users to search, select, and book apartments seamlessly.
- **Prototyping with Figma:** Initial UI/UX designs are crafted on Figma to ensure clarity and effectiveness in the design phase.

## Objective
This project integrates theoretical knowledge from the course into a practical application. The primary goal is to develop a functional prototype while enhancing my skills in software management and development practices.

## Technology Stack
- **Design Tool:** Figma for UI/UX prototyping
- **Programming Language:** TBD based on project requirements
- **Frameworks/Libraries:** TBD

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/OABS_Project.git
   ```
2. Open the prototype design files in Figma or other tools as specified.
3. Follow updates for the implementation phase in future commits.

## Project Progress
This repository will be updated in phases:
1. **Prototype Design:** UI/UX mockups (in progress)
2. **Backend and Frontend Implementation:** Details coming soon
3. **Testing and Deployment:** Planned for the final stage
